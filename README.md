# nand2tetris

As a self-taught developer, I believe baic stuff is the most important thing in Computer Science, so I decided to learn from the scratch. Nand2Tetris is one of the best 
course that taught me how to break stuff to smaller things and see what is fun. 

In this project, I have learnt and created from basic chips (OR/AND/NAND), Virtual Machine, ... to a complete complete project like (Snake/Tetris), then I wrote 
a compiler, operating system. 

Highly recommended for study purpose!
